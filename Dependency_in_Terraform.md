In Terraform, resource dependencies are managed automatically based on the expressions and references within your resource definitions. Terraform uses these references to determine the order of resource creation. However, when resources do not have direct references but still need to be created in a specific order, the `depends_on` meta-argument can be used to explicitly declare dependencies.

### Implicit Dependency
Terraform can often infer dependencies automatically when one resource references another. For example, if an EC2 instance depends on a security group, Terraform will understand the dependency by examining the references between resources.

#### Example of Implicit Dependency:
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  # Implicit dependency: This instance depends on the security group.
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]
}
```

In the above example:
- The EC2 instance (`aws_instance.example`) references the security group (`aws_security_group.example.id`).
- Terraform automatically detects that the security group must be created before the EC2 instance because of this reference.

### Explicit Dependency with `depends_on`
Sometimes, resources might not have direct references, but you still want to enforce a specific order. In such cases, you can use the `depends_on` argument to explicitly define dependencies.

#### Example of Explicit Dependency:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  # Explicit dependency: Ensure the S3 bucket is created before the instance.
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```

In this case:
- There is no direct reference between the S3 bucket and the EC2 instance, but by using `depends_on`, you are telling Terraform to create the S3 bucket before the EC2 instance.
- This is useful when there's a logical dependency (e.g., maybe the EC2 instance needs to use the bucket after being created), even though Terraform cannot infer it automatically.

### How Terraform Resolves Dependencies:
1. **Graph-Based Planning**: Terraform builds a dependency graph from the configuration. Each resource becomes a node in the graph, and edges between nodes represent the dependencies.
2. **Execution**: Terraform walks through the graph, ensuring resources are created or modified in the correct order, respecting both implicit and explicit dependencies.

### Key Points:
- **Implicit dependencies** are detected when one resource references another through attributes like `id`.
- **Explicit dependencies** can be defined using the `depends_on` meta-argument when there's no direct reference but a logical dependency exists.
  
### Example Use Case:
If you have a web server (`aws_instance`) that relies on an RDS database (`aws_db_instance`), you might not have direct references, but you know the database must be set up before the web server starts. Here, you could use `depends_on` to enforce this order:

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  allocated_storage = 20
  engine            = "mysql"
  instance_class    = "db.t2.micro"
  name              = "mydb"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  # Ensure the database is created first
  depends_on = [aws_db_instance.example]
}
```

This ensures that Terraform creates the database before the web server, even though there's no direct attribute reference between them.
